# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an AI-powered investment portfolio advisor system that integrates IBM watsonx.ai with LangChain agents. The system focuses on creating a sophisticated risk analytics agent that can analyze user assessment data, calculate objective risk metrics, and perform advanced stress testing including Monte Carlo simulations. The primary goal is to create an impressive hackathon demo that showcases multi-agent AI capabilities while providing professional-grade portfolio recommendations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Risk Analytics Agent Implementation

**User Story:** As a portfolio advisor system, I want an AI-powered risk analytics agent that can process user assessment data and generate comprehensive risk blueprints, so that portfolio recommendations are based on objective risk analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user assessment data is submitted THEN the risk analytics agent SHALL analyze the data using watsonx.ai
2. WHEN risk analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL distinguish between risk capacity (objective financial ability), risk tolerance (psychological comfort), and risk requirement (level of risk needed for goals)
3. WHEN calculating risk metrics THEN the system SHALL use financial ratios including Debt-to-Asset, Savings Rate, and Liquidity Ratio
4. WHEN processing time horizons THEN the system SHALL map them into bands (short-term <3y, medium 3-10y, long-term >10y)
5. WHEN generating risk blueprint THEN the system SHALL output a structured JSON with risk_capacity, risk_tolerance, risk_requirement, liquidity_constraints, time_horizon_bands, and risk_level_summary

### Requirement 2: Monte Carlo Stress Testing

**User Story:** As a risk analyst, I want the system to perform Monte Carlo simulations on portfolio scenarios, so that I can understand the probability of achieving financial goals under various market conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN risk analysis is requested THEN the system SHALL perform Monte Carlo simulations with random rate of return generation
2. WHEN stress testing is performed THEN the system SHALL test scenarios including market downturns, inflation surges, and interest rate shocks
3. WHEN Monte Carlo simulation runs THEN the system SHALL generate probability distributions for goal achievement
4. WHEN simulation completes THEN the system SHALL provide success probability percentages for different outcome scenarios
5. WHEN stress test results are generated THEN the system SHALL include scenario-based portfolio loss projections

### Requirement 3: Risk Score and Volatility Mapping

**User Story:** As a portfolio generation system, I want to convert risk analysis into quantified risk scores and corresponding volatility targets, so that asset screening can be performed based on objective risk metrics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN risk blueprint is generated THEN the system SHALL calculate a numerical risk score from the analysis
2. WHEN risk score is calculated THEN the system SHALL map it to a corresponding volatility target
3. WHEN volatility target is determined THEN the system SHALL use it for asset screening in subsequent portfolio generation
4. WHEN risk level is assessed THEN the system SHALL categorize it as low/medium/high with clear thresholds
5. WHEN risk metrics are calculated THEN the system SHALL provide benchmark comparisons for context

### Requirement 4: watsonx.ai Integration with Fallback

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the risk analytics agent to integrate seamlessly with watsonx.ai while maintaining reliability through fallback mechanisms, so that the system works consistently during demos.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN watsonx.ai is available THEN the system SHALL use it for all AI-powered risk analysis
2. WHEN watsonx.ai connection fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to cached responses or enhanced mock analysis
3. WHEN AI analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL complete within 10 seconds for demo reliability
4. WHEN fallback is triggered THEN the system SHALL maintain the same output format and quality
5. WHEN AI services are used THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling and retry logic

### Requirement 5: Multi-Agent Coordination

**User Story:** As a portfolio advisor system, I want the risk analytics agent to coordinate with other agents (portfolio and market agents), so that comprehensive investment recommendations can be generated through agent collaboration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN risk analysis completes THEN the system SHALL pass risk blueprint to the portfolio agent
2. WHEN agents coordinate THEN the system SHALL maintain context and session data across agent interactions
3. WHEN multi-agent workflow runs THEN the system SHALL provide visibility into which agent is processing what
4. WHEN agent coordination occurs THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully without breaking the workflow
5. WHEN agents communicate THEN the system SHALL log agent interactions for debugging and demo purposes

### Requirement 6: Professional Output and Explanations

**User Story:** As an end user, I want the risk analytics agent to provide clear, professional explanations of risk analysis results, so that I can understand the reasoning behind portfolio recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN risk analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL generate human-readable explanations for all risk metrics
2. WHEN stress test results are provided THEN the system SHALL explain scenario impacts in plain language
3. WHEN Monte Carlo results are generated THEN the system SHALL provide intuitive probability explanations
4. WHEN risk recommendations are made THEN the system SHALL include rationale for risk level assignments
5. WHEN analysis is presented THEN the system SHALL format results for both API consumption and user display

### Requirement 7: Assessment Data Integration

**User Story:** As a risk analytics agent, I want to seamlessly integrate with the existing assessment data structure, so that user financial profiles can be comprehensively analyzed without requiring additional data collection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN assessment data is received THEN the system SHALL parse all relevant fields including age, income, net_worth, dependents, time_horizon, risk_tolerance, and financial goals
2. WHEN financial ratios are calculated THEN the system SHALL derive metrics from available assessment data
3. WHEN data is insufficient THEN the system SHALL make reasonable assumptions and document them
4. WHEN assessment data is processed THEN the system SHALL validate data quality and flag inconsistencies
5. WHEN integration occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing API endpoints

### Requirement 8: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the risk analytics agent to perform efficiently and scale appropriately for hackathon demo scenarios, so that the system remains responsive under demo conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN risk analysis is requested THEN the system SHALL complete processing within 10 seconds
2. WHEN multiple requests are made THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent analysis requests
3. WHEN caching is implemented THEN the system SHALL cache similar risk profiles for faster response
4. WHEN system load increases THEN the system SHALL maintain response quality and speed
5. WHEN demo scenarios are run THEN the system SHALL pre-warm common analysis patterns for reliability
